## Getting Started

To get started with the Trakt Sync application, you can use Docker to run the service. Below is a sample `docker-compose.yml` file that you can use to set up the application.

### Docker Compose Configuration

```yaml
services:
  api:
    image: lfmachadodasilva/trakt-sync:latest
    container_name: trakt-sync
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### Running the Application

1. Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.
2. Create a directory named `data`. This directory will be used to store the application's data, e.g., configuration files and database.
3. Run the following command to start the application:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
4. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Running Locally

If you prefer to run the application locally without Docker, you can follow these steps:

### Backend Setup

1. Install Go 1.24.3 on your machine.
2. Run the following commands to set up the backend:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   go run cmd/api/
   ```
3. Check folder http/ for `.http` files to test the API endpoints.
4. The backend will start on port `4000` by default when you run the application locally (outside of Docker).

### Frontend Setup

1. Install bun https://bun.sh/
2. Run the following commands to set up the frontend:

   ```bash
   cd cmd/web
   bun install
   bun dev
   ```

3. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.
